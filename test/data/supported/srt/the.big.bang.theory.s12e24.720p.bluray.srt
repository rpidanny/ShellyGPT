1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,560
Carbon.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
Hydrogen.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Carbon.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
Carbon.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,634
And last but not least,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,870
carbon.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,113
This might be the glue talking,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,591
but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
Agreed.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,119
What kind of DNA is this, anyway?

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,080
I was trying to design the genetic code
of an advanced race of human being.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,629
- One of my rare failures, actually.
- What went wrong?

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,076
The balls kept sticking to my pants.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,394
Let's just let it dry.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,520
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,080
- Don't slam the...
- Don't slam the...

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,480
That was exhilarating.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,114
- Picked up your dresses?
- Yep.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,471
The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,677
Best day of my life.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,199
What about the day you met me?

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,158
I stand by my statement.

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,958
Thank you, guys, so much for the clothes

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,520
and the shoes, the plane tickets.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,829
You've been so generous.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,576
Well, it's important
that all of our friends

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,954
get to share this moment with us.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,952
And then for years to come,
you can tell others

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,679
you had a front-row seat to history.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
Although, technically, I think
your seats are in the second row.

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,120
Do you want to go back to the apartment
and see me try on my dress?

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,656
Shouldn't I see it for the first time
at the Nobel ceremony?

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,034
It's not a wedding.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,600
Okay. Well, give me a minute

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,640
to think of another reason
I don't want to see it.

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,438
How about this?

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,736
You can practice your acceptance speech
while I try on the dress.

38
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,559
Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,596
Was Amy suspicious
when they had to let your dress out?

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,240
No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,760
Someone's gonna figure it out.
Why don't we just tell people?

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,136
No, it's too early. I haven't even
wrapped my head around it.

43
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,470
- I have. My head is wrapped.
- Yeah, well,

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,280
if something else had been wrapped,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,831
Excuse me, but if I recall,

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,496
you're the one
who went out drinking with Sheldon,

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,760
then came home and attacked me.

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,634
Attacked you?
I think, I said, "Do you wanna?"

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,836
Yeah.

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
And I was helpless.

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,596
Huh-uh?

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,909
So...

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,229
Do you wanna?

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,797
- Well, I can't get more pregnant.
- Hmm.

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,234
- We'll see about that.
- Huh-uh?

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,592
<i>Our whole universe
was in a hot dense state</i>

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,832
<i>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started...</i>

58
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,838
<i>Wait!</i>

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
<i>The earth began to cool</i>

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>The autotrophs began to drool</i>

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,993
<i>Neanderthals developed tools</i>

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,072
<i>We built a wall
We built the pyramids</i>

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,720
<i>Math, science, history
Unraveling the mystery</i>

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,314
<i>It all started with the Big Bang!</i>

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,198
<i>Bang!</i>

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,718
Now, Michael, Mommy and Daddy
are going away for a couple days,

67
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,376
so if you're gonna say your first words,

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,960
you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

69
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,796
Somebody just peed
in the big girl potty.

70
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,951
I'm so proud!

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
It was her, right?

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Yes.

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,479
You still feel good about leaving them

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,120
with Stuart and Denise
for a couple days?

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,511
I guess. I just hope
we don't miss Michael's first words.

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,193
Or Stuart's last words.

77
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,037
You realize it's been years
since we've got away just the two of us.

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,277
I know. I can't wait.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,359
Fancy hotel room. The big bed.

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,031
Yeah. We're gonna sleep our asses off.

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,036
You really think walking her
is gonna help me meet girls?

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,034
Cinnamon is chick bait.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,798
Good. 'Cause I'm not.

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,275
Just remember, you're in charge.

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,794
Don't let her pull you.

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,439
That seems like
an unnecessary thing to say.

87
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,354
And please,
if you have any problems, any questions,

88
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,874
call me immediately, okay?

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,639
She's my baby.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,877
It shouldn't come up, but just in case,

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,998
where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,356
Kidding.
If she dies, I'll just tell you.

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Ready?

94
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Hang on.

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,315
Go.

96
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,136
"Your Majesties,
members of the Nobel Academy,

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,616
when I was a young boy
growing up in East Texas,

98
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,896
I always knew
I'd wind up on this stage.

99
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,056
And everybody who said I wouldn't,

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,776
looks pretty darn foolish right now.
I'm talking about you,

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,256
high-school science teacher,
Mr. Hubert Givens..."

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,239
Sheldon, Sheldon.
Why are you talking so fast?

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,232
I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

104
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,069
Nobody's gonna be able to understand
a word you're saying.

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,435
Welcome to my life.

106
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,913
I think you need to do some editing,

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,469
like maybe cut out all that stuff
about your childhood.

108
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,676
Are you kidding?

109
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,752
Growing up in the backwoods
of East Texas

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,399
is what makes me warm and relatable.

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,432
Well, what about all these pages

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,597
calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,117
I told them all they would rue the day.

114
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,635
How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,313
and they're not filled with rue?

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,675
Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

117
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,037
This is about
humbly accepting a great honor.

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,471
Amy, we won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

119
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,120
Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels,

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,118
like Literature, Economics and Peace.

121
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,478
Please tell me
that's not in your speech.

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,076
I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,069
All right, bagels down.

124
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,680
Before we head to the airport,
I'd like to go over a few things.

125
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,031
From the moment we step off the plane,

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,316
each and every one of you
is an ambassador

127
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,556
for Amy and myself.

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,559
I told you these tickets weren't free.

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,037
As such, your behavior
must reflect the highest standards...

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,918
Raj. Bagel down.

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,914
If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

132
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,151
- Amy, why don't you kick us off.
- Thank you.

133
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,351
"The challenging climate of Scandinavia

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,511
has left its mark on
the Swedish character.

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,032
These dour, latter-day Vikings
are slow to warm up to strangers,

136
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,558
but if you follow a few easy steps,
a Swede can be your friend for life."

137
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,150
All right. "Number one,

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,199
in Sweden,
punctuality is taken very seriously.

139
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,114
In other words,
the loosey-goosey attitude in Helsinki

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,714
will not fly in Stockholm."

141
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,440
"Two, at the beginning and end
of all business and social meetings,

142
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,877
shake hands with everyone present.
Men, women and children."

143
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,429
Yes, you're all encouraged
to pair off and practice this

144
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,637
once we're in the air
and the seat belt sign is off.

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,515
Yes, Penny?

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,319
Oh, do we have to go?

147
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,198
Yes. And a reminder, Penny,
there's free alcohol in business class.

148
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Don't abuse it.

149
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,715
Relax. I'm not gonna drink.

150
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,599
- Why? You pregnant?
- Wha... No.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,277
No, I just, you know,
I don't like to drink when I fly.

152
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,757
Please. I've seen you
drink in the shower.

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,354
You guys have showered together?

154
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,679
Sometimes you're just...

155
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,594
That wasn't a no.

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,336
All right, well, we should head out now

157
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,720
if we're gonna get to the airport
six hours before boarding.

158
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,114
Excuse me. Hello?

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,954
What did we just learn about
the end of business meetings?

160
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,355
Oh, my God.

161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,759
Yeah, great. Whatever.

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,550
Go on. You first. Go.

163
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,236
Wait.

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,470
Help me!

165
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,631
- Help me!
- Oh, wait. Come here.

166
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
- We got this.
- Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Hang on.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,273
I've got an idea.

169
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,835
Well done.

170
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,072
You know, you're proving to be
an invaluable part of my entourage.

171
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Cool.

172
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,440
Yeah?

173
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,353
- How you doing?
- Fine. Why?

174
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,592
Well, this is the furthest
we've ever been away from the kids.

175
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,280
I was just checking
to see if you're okay.

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm on my second <i>Jack Reacher.</i>
I'm doing great.

177
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,075
Good. Me, too.
I was just looking at the map.

178
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,232
Couldn't help thinking
we're here and they're there,

179
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,630
and if anything happened,
we'd have to go here

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,155
to get all the way back there.

181
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,840
Why are you trying to freak me out?

182
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,431
This is our vacation.
I thought we should do things together.

183
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,440
Howie, the kids are okay.

184
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
How do you know that?

185
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,791
I just know. A mother knows.

186
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,278
So what, now the Force is with you?

187
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Let's see.

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,395
This is not the woman you want to annoy.

189
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,792
- Howard. Howard.
- What?

190
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,992
You see the woman sitting next to me?

191
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
What about her?

192
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
Is this her?

193
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,513
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

194
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,319
Be cool.

195
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,517
- No, that's not her.
- Okay.

196
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,080
How about now?

197
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,110
Uh-oh!

198
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,717
That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,950
in the last two hours.

200
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
So?

201
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,119
Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

202
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
So?

203
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,871
So she clearly has
some sort of stomach distress.

204
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,792
If it's viral, we're all susceptible.

205
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,199
She's probably just airsick.

206
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,034
Yeah, but what if she's not?
What if we get what she has?

207
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,879
What if we infect the King of Sweden?

208
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,394
That's how wars start.

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,314
All right, that's it.
This is <i>Outbreak</i> and she's the monkey.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,515
Wait. Stop. Be reasonable.

211
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,831
Leonard, we need to
do something about your wife.

212
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,496
- What's the matter?
- She is clearly sick,

213
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,096
and she's gonna
take us all down with her.

214
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
She's not sick, Sheldon.

215
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,273
She is, and I'm gonna catch it,

216
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,176
and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

217
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,590
I promise
you're not going to get what she has.

218
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,909
What's going on?

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,354
Unclean! Unclean!

220
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
What?

221
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,830
He thinks you're sick.

222
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,430
Oh!

223
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,030
Should we tell him?

224
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,920
Well, if we don't, he might try
and jump out of the plane.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,514
Yeah, doesn't answer my question.

226
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,316
Tell me what?

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,679
I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

228
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,080
You're right, I can't catch that.

229
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,834
Good news, Amy.

230
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,400
She's just pregnant.

231
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,555
Are you kidding me?

232
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,599
You just found out that
a woman who has loved and cared for you

233
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,639
for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

234
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,720
you're relieved
that she's not gonna get you sick?

235
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,160
There's no need for a recap.
I was there.

236
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,556
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anybody.

237
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,518
I'm not anybody. I'm your best friend.

238
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,673
- What's going on?
- She's pregnant.

239
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,638
That's fantastic!

240
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,279
Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,635
She didn't tell me, either.

242
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,074
But I'm her best friend.

243
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,640
We'll get into that later.

244
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,111
What happened to
"I'm never gonna have kids"?

245
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,396
It was an accident.
I went out drinking with Sheldon.

246
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,671
Oh, my gosh.

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,229
We're sister wives?

248
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,470
No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

249
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,359
- While fantasizing about...
- Leonard.

250
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,550
And a little Idris Elba.

251
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,599
- I mean...
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,474
What would you like me to say?

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,159
How about congratulating us?

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,798
Are congratulations even in order?
I didn't think Penny wanted children.

255
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,520
Well, she didn't, now she does.
And just so you know,

256
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
we weren't gonna tell anybody
so we wouldn't upstage your big day.

257
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,831
Oh, please, you couldn't upstage us.
We won a Nobel Prize.

258
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,593
Any idiot can have a baby.

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,440
Hey. What's going on?

260
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,636
Case in point.

261
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,877
You are a selfish jerk.

262
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,553
To hell with you and your Nobel Prize.

263
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,074
I found her boarding pass in her purse.
It's totally her.

264
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,034
Hi, Stuart, just checking in.
Seeing if everything's okay.

265
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,556
<i>Oh, yeah, we're having fun.</i>

266
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,438
<i>Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.</i>

267
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,756
- Oh, that's nice.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

268
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,036
<i>I found Denise right away.</i>

269
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Where was Halley hiding?

270
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,070
<i>Uh, the important thing is
she's not there now.</i>

271
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,032
Okay, so, everyone's happy and healthy?

272
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,635
<i>- Well, that depends.</i>
- What's that mean?

273
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
<i>How many teeth
did Halley have when you left?</i>

274
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,875
All of them.

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,834
<i>Oh, yeah, that's what I was afraid of.</i>

276
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
What happened?

277
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,113
<i>Ah, well, all right.</i>

278
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,273
<i>Um, Michael had
a little fever last night.</i>

279
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Michael had a fever?

280
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,591
<i>Do you want to hear about Halley or not?</i>

281
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,074
What happened, Stuart?

282
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,994
<i>He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.</i>

283
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,120
<i>And Halley, bless her heart,
wanted to bring him his boo-boo bear,</i>

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,317
<i>so she climbed over the safety rail</i>

285
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,433
<i>and took a little tumble
down the stairs.</i>

286
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,313
She fell down the stairs?

287
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,031
<i>She rolled down the stairs,
laughing the whole time.</i>

288
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,157
<i>Anyway, when she got to the bottom,
there was a tooth missing.</i>

289
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,475
Stuart!

290
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,597
<i>She's fine! She thought it was funny.</i>

291
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,431
Did you at least
save it for the tooth fairy?

292
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,432
<i>No, we couldn't find it.</i>

293
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,671
<i>We have a theory about where it is,</i>

294
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,952
<i>but it'll take
six to eight hours to confirm.</i>

295
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

296
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,669
<i>where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?</i>

297
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,056
Come on,
you didn't seriously expect him

298
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,878
to react like a normal human being.

299
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,679
No, but still,

300
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,117
after all these years,
after all the crap I've put up with,

301
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,551
you'd think, just this once,
he'd care about someone else's feelings.

302
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,393
- Oh, my God!
- What?

303
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,870
Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

304
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,440
Really?

305
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,751
Sounds gross. Looks gross. Smells gross.

306
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,112
It's delicious!

307
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,915
Ooh, that might be my salted cod!

308
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
What?

309
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,751
Sheldon has something he'd like to say.

310
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,071
I'm sorry I didn't react appropriately.

311
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,277
You and Penny
are bringing new life into the world.

312
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,511
Congratulations.
I can't wait to meet it.

313
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,990
- "It"?
- That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

314
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,515
If you're offended,
take it up with the English language.

315
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,831
Oh, good, you're here. Listen,

316
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,317
we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

317
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,715
- Why?
- We just can't

318
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,200
be this far away from the kids.

319
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,352
Bernie's having a meltdown,
and, frankly, so am I.

320
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,909
Yeah, well, pull it together.
This is a big day for me.

321
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,316
Yeah, I wasn't sure what to do.

322
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,879
Now I am. We're going home.

323
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,996
We'll join you.

324
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,280
Wait. Do I get a vote in this?

325
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,776
They'll have pickled herring
on the plane.

326
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,916
Bye-bye.

327
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,594
Well, I hate to say it,

328
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,593
but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

329
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,949
Well, you would be
the authority on the subject.

330
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
What does that mean?

331
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,400
Sheldon, no one is happier than I am
to win the Nobel.

332
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,039
But it's not more important
than our friends.

333
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,111
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?

334
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,076
They're abandoning us
because you broke their hearts.

335
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,237
- I didn't mean to.
- I know!

336
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,158
You never mean to.

337
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,234
That's the only reason
people tolerate you!

338
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,873
Does that include you?

339
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,880
Sometimes, yeah.

340
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,070
Okay, that's it for the fish.

341
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,637
We'll be back with the meatballs
after a short word from our sponsor.

342
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,155
Oh, thank you.

343
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,591
Leonard, I can't go home.

344
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,111
- I have to be there for Amy.
- Yeah.

345
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,157
I was thinking that, too.

346
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,950
As angry as I am at Sheldon,
I still want to see him win that medal.

347
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,633
Hmm, it's so strange.

348
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,077
No matter
how thoughtless and selfish he is,

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,393
I still love him.

350
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,116
If you think about it,
he has kind of been our practice kid.

351
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,393
Like when you make pancakes

352
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,676
and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

353
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,077
The university prefers "quirky."

354
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,431
Hello. Hey. It's Howard.

355
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,274
Oh, us, too.

356
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,238
- Wait, what?
- They're gonna stay.

357
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,835
The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

358
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,596
Really?

359
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,639
Oh, poor little guy.

360
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,876
Is Michael okay?

361
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,996
Yeah, it's Stuart.

362
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,760
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

363
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,279
Yeah. Okay, we'll meet you in the lobby.

364
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,640
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?

365
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,957
I just need, like, five or ten minutes.

366
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,953
- Really?
- No. What is wrong with you?

367
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,278
And in the field of physics,

368
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,274
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

369
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,398
for their discovery of super-asymmetry.

370
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,877
Just to be clear, this isn't a date.

371
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Yeah, I know.

372
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,759
Then why are you holding my hand?

373
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,839
Thank you, Your Majesties.

374
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,480
Thank you to the Nobel Committee.

375
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,151
We are deeply honored.

376
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,591
I would just like to take this moment

377
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,320
to say to all the young girls out there

378
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,393
who dream about science
as a profession...

379
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,675
Go for it.

380
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,838
It is the greatest job in the world.

381
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,679
And if anybody tells you you can't,
don't listen.

382
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,833
And now,

383
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,513
speaking of not listening,

384
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,037
my husband, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

385
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Sheldon.

386
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,234
What? Did you finish... Great job.

387
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,474
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

388
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,712
I have a very long
and somewhat self-centered speech here.

389
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,957
But I'd like to set it aside.

390
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,434
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,959
Because this honor
doesn't just belong to me.

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,070
I wouldn't be up here

393
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,551
if it weren't for some
very important people in my life.

394
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,878
Beginning with my mother,
father, Meemaw,

395
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,313
brother and sister.

396
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,714
And my other family,

397
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,235
who I'm so happy to have here with us.

398
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,797
Is that Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

399
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,795
I was under a misapprehension
that my accomplishments were mine alone.

400
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,517
Nothing could be further from the truth.

401
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,354
I have been encouraged, sustained,

402
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,511
inspired and tolerated,

403
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,154
not only by my wife,

404
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,314
but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

405
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,792
I'd like to ask them to stand.

406
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,678
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

407
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,310
Dr. Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

408
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,716
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

409
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,835
And my two dearest friends in the world,

410
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,910
Penny Hofstadter

411
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,557
and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

412
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,600
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

413
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,110
He said to me that their babies
would be smart and beautiful.

414
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,760
And now that they're expecting,

415
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,309
I have no doubt
that that will be the case.

416
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,320
Thanks, Sheldon.

417
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:12,391
I haven't told my parents yet,
but thanks.

418
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,595
Don't tell anyone that last thing.
That's a secret.

420
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,120
Howard, Bernadette,

421
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,471
Raj, Penny, Leonard,

422
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,437
I apologize if I haven't been
the friend you deserve.

423
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,516
But I want you to know,

424
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,229
in my way,

425
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,675
I love you all.

426
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,354
And I love you.

427
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Thank you.

428
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,437
<i>Our whole universe
was in a hot dense state</i>

429
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,231
<i>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started...</i>

430
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,674
<i>Wait!</i>

431
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,151
<i>The earth began to cool</i>

432
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,118
<i>The autotrophs began to drool</i>

433
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
<i>Neanderthals developed tools</i>

434
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,470
<i>We built a wall
We built the pyramids</i>

435
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,919
<i>Math, science, history
Unraveling the mystery</i>

436
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,040
<i>That all started with the Big Bang!</i>
